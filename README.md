# Data Science Repository

This repository contains my structured work in Data Science using Python.
It is organized topic-wise and focuses on building strong fundamentals through
practical, well-documented Jupyter notebooks.

The repository is intended to reflect a disciplined and progressive approach
towards learning Data Science concepts relevant for real-world analysis.

## Current Scope
At present, the repository includes material related to NumPy, which serves
as the foundational library for numerical computing and array-based operations
in Data Science.

## Contents
- Concept-focused Jupyter notebooks
- Clear examples demonstrating core NumPy operations
- Emphasis on vectorized computation and correct data handling

## Topics Implemented
- NumPy array creation and properties
- Indexing and slicing
- Vectorized operations
- Broadcasting rules
- Array stacking and transformations
- Element-wise mathematical and logical operations

## Planned Expansion
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Data visualization techniques
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- SQL for analytical querying
- Introductory Machine Learning models

## Tools
- Python
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
- VS Code

## Objective
To practice and build a foundation in Data Science.

## Status
Actively maintained and updated as learning progresses.
